# lita-lack-tandup

lita-slack-standup is a gem for Lita (https://www.lita.io/), a chat bot written in ruby.  
It handles standup meetings on slack (the sentences are in french for now).

## Installation

Add lita-standup to your Lita instance's Gemfile:

``` ruby
gem "lita-standup"
```

## Configuration

In your lita configuration file (lita_config.rb), add the lines :
``` ruby
Lita.congifure do |config|
  config.handlers.slack_standup.channel = ENV['STANDUP_CHANNEL']
end
```

And set the environment variable STANDUP_CHANNEL, with the name of the channel where you want to held the standup.

## Test

We used VCR generated by real standups on slack. We had to delete them for privacy reasons.  
To rerun the tests and recreate some VCR, you need to bundle the gem into a lita bot.

## Usage

 - !standup start : launches the standup, prints the standups already filled and asks for someone else to report
 - !standup next : skips the current user and asks the next user to do his standup report
 - !standup report <some standup report> : saves your standup. If you do it before the start of the standup, you won't be asked to report. The bot will displays your standup in your stead
 - !standup ignore <some user> : ignores an user for the standups
 - !standup unignore <some user> : unignores an user
 - !standup list : list all ignored users
  
The standup stops when everyone has done his report or has been skipped.
